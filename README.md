# ASD-Prediction-Analysis
In this project, machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, logistic regression, and KNN, are employed to predict the presence of ASD in adults. The overarching objective is to identify the most accurate approach for ASD prediction based on the characteristics present in the dataset.
The ASD Prediction Analysis Project successfully employs machine learning techniques to predict Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in adults, using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project aims to develop an effective predictive model for early ASD detection.

The project initiates with a detailed exploration and preprocessing of the dataset, identifying key features and the dependent variable indicating ASD status. Machine learning models, including decision trees, logistic regression, and KNN, are implemented for ASD prediction. A comparative analysis is conducted to determine the most effective model.

Validation of project findings involves a comprehensive review of relevant literature, emphasizing the significance of early ASD detection and its impact on healthcare costs. Logistic Regression emerges as the most accurate model, aligning with the results of Thabtah's (2017) study, further validating its effectiveness in ASD prediction.

The project recognizes the importance of efficient ASD screening methods in light of the global prevalence of the disorder. It acknowledges the need for more extensive datasets to enhance model generalization and recommends exploring deep learning techniques for future research to refine and improve ASD prediction models.

Contributing valuable insights to the field of neurodevelopmental healthcare, the ASD Prediction Analysis Project provides an effective model for early ASD detection in adults. The documented findings and methodologies serve as a foundation for further research in developing accurate and efficient ASD screening methods.
